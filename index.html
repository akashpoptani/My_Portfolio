        <p style="font-size: 16px;">I'm a final year student at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Dharwad, Karnataka. I'm pursuing a Bachelor of technology (B.Tech) in Electrical Engineering. I was working as a Research Assistant on GPU architectures for Graphics at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC), Barcelona, under the guidance of <a href=https://sites.google.com/view/antonio-upc>Prof. Antonio Gonzalez</a> from December 2023 to March 2024.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">My <a href="research.html">research interests</a> include Computer Architecture, Runtime Verification, Hardware Security, Architecture Simulation, Machine Learning and Deep Learning. I have worked on Secure Systems (Acceleration using Assisted Parallelism), Runtime Verification (Design and Development of Runtime monitor processors) and Computer Architecture (Extending the Tejas architectural simulator with power (McPAT) and temperature (Hotspot) modeling capabilities, Hardware Prefetching and Branch Prediction Techniques) under the guidance of <a href="https://iitdh.ac.in/rajshekar.k/index.html">Prof. Rajshekar K</a></p>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">During my internship at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), under the guidance of <a href="https://eeweiz.home.ece.ust.hk/">Prof. Wei Zhang</a>, I embarked on a project involving the hardware implementation of a prefetcher architecture for a multi-AI core system to accelerate Transformer model, employing Verilog. This experience introduced me to advanced tools like SMAUG and gem5-aladdin that I utilized to optimize performance by integrating a prefetcher and dead-block predictor. I was also introduced to architectures for Matrix Multiplication operations. This journey culminated in the successful submission of a paper, "LCM: LLM-focused Hybrid SPM-cache Architecture with Cache Management for Multi-Core AI Accelerators" to the esteemed ACM International Conference on Supercomputing (ICS) 2024.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">I have also worked as a research intern at Arizona State University(ASU), Tata Consultancy services (TCS) Banglore , IIT Dharwad, IIT Ropar in the domains of ML in EDA, TinyML, Task Scheduling algorithms, and Cache Replacement and Partitioning Policies. My journey as a researcher reflects a dynamic blend of theoretical knowledge, hands-on experimentation, and collaborative spirit. My passion continues to drive my pursuit of innovative solutions and breakthroughs in these domains.</p>

            <h2>Project Collaboration Opportunity</h2>
            <p>
                I'm currently working on a project focused on Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning models.
                I'm passionate about pushing the boundaries of this field and exploring new avenues for advancement. That's why I'm actively seeking collaborations with other students and faculty members who share a similar interest in extending the scope of research in this domain. If you're intrigued by my work and have ideas to contribute or if you simply want to connect and discuss potential collaborations, feel free to drop me a message or email me at 200020005@iitdh.ac.in or akashpoptani17@gmail.com .
