        <p style="font-size: 16px;">I'm a final year student at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Dharwad, Karnataka. I'm pursuing a Bachelor of technology (B.Tech) in Electrical Engineering. I've begun working as a Research Assistant at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC), Barcelona, under the guidance of <a href=https://sites.google.com/view/antonio-upc>Prof. Antonio Gonzalez</a> in the month of December.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">My <a href="research.html">research interests</a> include Computer Architecture, Runtime Verification, Hardware Security, Architecture Simulation, Machine Learning and Deep Learning. I have worked on Runtime Verification (Design and Development of Runtime monitor processors) and Computer Architecture (Extending the Tejas architectural simulator with power (McPAT) and temperature (Hotspot) modeling capabilities, Hardware Prefetching and Branch Prediction Techniques) under the guidance of <a href="https://iitdh.ac.in/rajshekar.k/index.html">Prof. Rajshekar K</a></p>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">During my internship at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), under the guidance of <a href="https://eeweiz.home.ece.ust.hk/">Prof. Wei Zhang</a>, I embarked on a project involving the hardware implementation of a prefetcher architecture for a multi-AI core system, employing Verilog. This experience introduced me to advanced tools like SMAUG and gem5-aladdin that I utilized to optimize performance by integrating a prefetcher and dead-block predictor. This journey culminated in the successful submission of a paper, "LCM: LLM-focused Hybrid SPM-cache Architecture with Cache Management for Multi-Core AI Accelerators" to the esteemed IEEE International Parallel \& Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS'24).</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">I have also worked as a research intern at Arizona State University(ASU), Tata Consultancy services (TCS) Banglore , IIT Dharwad, IIT Ropar in the domains of ML in EDA, TinyML, Task Scheduling algorithms, and Cache Replacement and Partitioning Policies. My journey as a researcher reflects a dynamic blend of theoretical knowledge, hands-on experimentation, and collaborative spirit. My passion continues to drive my pursuit of innovative solutions and breakthroughs in these domains.</p>
